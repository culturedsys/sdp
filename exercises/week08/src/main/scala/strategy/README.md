# Briefly describe the Strategy Design Pattern?

The strategy design pattern allows for implementation of a specified piece of functionality to be switched between
different concrete implementations at runtime. It is implemented by an abstract type (interface or trait) declaring a
method denoting that specified piece of functionality, with concrete subclasses providing the specific
implementations of that functionality.

# When is it appropriate to use the Strategy Design Pattern?

The pattern is useful where an application wishes to use many different implementations of some functionality, and
switch between them at runtime.
